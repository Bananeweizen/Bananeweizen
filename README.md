### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionate about open source, mainly in the Java ecosystem. You have almost certainly used some of my contributions at some point of time (I've contributed patches to the [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org) software powering [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/)). I'm committer on several [Eclipse projects](https://www.eclipse.org/). Some projects with larger contributions are:
* [cgeo - a great geocaching app for Android](https://www.cgeo.org/)
* [egit - the Eclipse git integration plugin](https://www.eclipse.org/egit/)
* [TV-Browser - a free EPG](https://www.tvbrowser.org/)

You can find more of [my contributions on OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/accounts/Bananeweizen).
